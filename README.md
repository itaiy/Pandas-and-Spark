# Pandas-and-Spark
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a fast and powerful open-source data analysis and manipulation framework written in Python.
<br>
[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.
<br>
Both are widely adopted in the Data Engineering and Data Science communities.

Even though there's a great value in combining them in terms of productivity, scalability and performance, it's often overlooked.

The notebooks in this repository demonstrate how you can **leverage recent developments in Apache Spark together with Pandas to enjoy the best of both worlds!**
